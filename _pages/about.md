I am currently a student in [Msc Mechanical Engineering, Track Biomechanical Design of Tu delft](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/education/programmes/masters/mechanical-engineering/msc-mechanical-engineering/track-overview/track-biomechanical-design).
As a lover of Robotics, I am interested in **autonomous control** for **Robot Manipulator**,**Legged Robot** and **Medical Robot**, especially for the **force control** and **MPC** topic. Recently, I gain interest in how  **Reinforcement learning** works in Robotics systems.
In the past few years, I obtained my BSc degree at [Beihang university](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beihang_University). In the meantime, I worked in **quadruped robot** and **mobile robot** in Beihang Robot team and got 3 national first price for [ABU ROBOCON Competition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABU_Robocon). I **studied manipulator force control of Medical robot** as a research intern at State Key Laboratory of Management and Control for Complex Systems at [CASIA](http://english.ia.cas.cn/).
